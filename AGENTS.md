# QuantForge — Agent Operating Guide

## Project Identity

Cross-sectional multi-asset paper trading engine. 18-asset portfolio (FX, commodities, equity indices) with per-asset XGBoost models, regime-conditional ensemble (disabled 2026-06-20; see ADR-026 and PnL backtest section), 9-layer governance, position sizing guardrails, and MT5 bridge execution (Exness demo via Wine).

**2026-06-20: AUDNZD, EURUSD, AUDCHF removed from trading.** These 3 assets accounted for the model's confirmed directional instability failure mode (confident wrong-direction bets during trends). Removed from paper_trading.yaml assets, mt5_symbol_map, shadow analytics, risk-off suppression lists, and API commission table. 22-3=19 remaining assets. See the Walk-Forward PnL Backtest section for the full diagnostic chain.

**2026-06-20 (late): GBPNZD removed from trading; USDCAD/NZDUSD allocation halved.** GBPNZD had tp/sl=1.0/3.0 (ratio 0.33), requiring 75% breakeven WR. Model achieved 72.3% — close but net-negative (-37R, -71R max_dd). USDCAD and NZDUSD reduced from 5% to 2.5% allocation to limit their drawdown impact while keeping diversification. 19-1=18 remaining assets.

## Architecture Quick Reference

- **Models**: Per-asset XGBClassifier (base only) — regime-conditional ensemble disabled 2026-06-20 (walk-forward p=0.83; see ADR-026)
- **Features**: 13 alpha (includes COT flag) + 7 regime (hurst, kaufman_er, adx, vol_zscore, compression, utc_hour, session_vol_profile)
- **Labels**: Triple-barrier with per-asset pt_sl, vertical_barrier=20, gap >= vb
- **Config**: `configs/paper_trading.yaml` — global defaults + per-asset (18 assets)
- **Inference**: `paper_trading/inference/pipeline.py` — alpha features → base model → governance → execute (ensemble disabled; regime features still generated for trace logging)
- **Training**: `paper_trading/inference/training.py` — base model only (regime model skipped when base_weight >= 1.0), scale_pos_weight, meta-labeling. Expanding-window (all history, never drops old data) — known contributor to directional instability across folds.
- **Entry gates**: `entry_service.py` price deviation check (skips if price deviated > max_entry_slippage_pct); `decision_pipeline.py` profit lock (blocks flips when unrealized PnL > profit_lock_threshold_pct)
- **Position sizing guardrails**: Drawdown taper, per-position equity cap, risk-per-trade cap, portfolio leverage budget (atomic lock), backstop decay multiplier
- **Independent MT5 sizing**: Paper sized from paper equity ($100K mtm_value); MT5 sized from real broker account balance via `_compute_mt5_qty()` with its own drawdown taper + risk cap
- **Orchestrator**: `EngineOrchestrator` (ThreadPoolExecutor, 8 workers), 3-phase cycle (signal → entry → backstop)
- **MT5 Bridge**: `paper_trading/ops/mt5_client.py` — TCP frame protocol to Wine-hosted MT5 (port 9879)
- **Dashboard**: React SPA on port 5000, state via `state.json`

## Position Sizing Chain

Paper positions are sized through multiplicative guardrails:

```
effective_cap = capital_base × min(mtm / initial_capital, 3.0)
size_scalar = base × exposure × governance × meta × drawdown_taper
notional = effective_cap × size_scalar
→ cap by max_position_pct_of_equity
→ cap by risk_per_trade_pct (skip if below min_viable_position_pct)
→ atomic decrement from shared leverage_budget (lock-protected)
```

MT5 positions are sized independently:

```
mt5_equity = broker.get_account_summary().portfolio_value
notional = mt5_equity × max_position_pct_of_equity × drawdown_taper
→ cap by risk_per_trade_pct (skip if below min_viable)
→ validate min volume via _quantity_to_lots()
```

Log lines: `SIZING` (paper) and `MT5_SIZING` (MT5) with all decomposed factors.

## Known Issues

- **GBPNZD (REMOVED 2026-06-20)**: tp/sl ratio 0.33 required 75% breakeven WR, model achieved 72.3% — net-negative. Removed from trading.
- **AUDNZD ensemble**: Ensemble degrades signal quality (IC -0.020 in pilot). Confirmed portfolio-wide by walk-forward (p=0.83 pooled); ensemble disabled 2026-06-20 (see ADR-026).
- **Small MT5 equity ($107 demo)**: 0.01 lot minimum for forex (≈$1,150 notional on EURUSD) far exceeds the MT5 position budget (≈$15.67 at 15% of $104). MT5 positions quantize to 0.01 lots regardless of computed size. Leverage budget is deferred for MT5 — revisit when equity > $10K.
- **Leverage budget deferred for MT5**: 0.01 lot granularity makes desired-vs-actual notional diverge wildly for small accounts. No leverage cap check on MT5 side until equity supports meaningful multi-position sizing.
- **SL/TP triple bug (FIXED 2026-06-16)**: Three independent issues (deactivated `atr_mult_tp`, uncalibrated `atr_mult_sl`, TP compiler convexity applied to inflated SL distance) produced TP distances up to 44%. Fixes: (1) `_atr_barriers()` now uses `atr_mult_tp` for TP vol basis, (2) `tp_compiler.py` caps R:R at `MAX_RR=5.0`.
- **THIN liquidity (FIXED 2026-06-17)**: THIN regime was routing to hard_reasons (halted all assets). Fixed: only STRESSED halts; THIN → soft_warnings (SL/size adjust, no halt).
- **Prob drift min samples (FIXED 2026-06-17)**: Raised from 3 to 10 for stable mean estimate before confidence drift halt check activates.
- **Entry price deviation gate (ADDED 2026-06-17)**: `entry_service.py` compares `asset.current_price` to signal `entry_price` before submitting. Skips if deviation > `max_entry_slippage_pct` (default 2%).
- **Profit lock gate (ADDED 2026-06-17)**: `decision_pipeline.py` checks unrealized PnL before flipping. Blocks flip if PnL > `profit_lock_threshold_pct` (default 15%).
- **Position sizing guardrails (ADDED 2026-06-17)**: drawdown taper (linear between start_dd/end_dd), per-position equity cap, risk-per-trade cap, portfolio leverage budget (atomic lock decrement), backstop decay (penalty × 0.9/cycle on breach-free cycles).
- **Independent MT5 sizing (ADDED 2026-06-17)**: MT5 computes own qty from broker equity with separate drawdown taper and risk cap. Paper sizing unchanged at $100K equity.
- **Ensemble breakdown logger column prefix (FIXED 2026-06-19)**: `_log_ensemble_breakdown` used `f"{asset_name_u}_carry_vol_adj"` but actual feature columns use `CLOSE_` prefix (from `prices.to_frame("close")`). All feature contributions logged as NaN. Fixed in `paper_trading/inference/pipeline.py:302`.
- **Carry feature always zero (FIXED 2026-06-19)**: `rate_diffs` DataFrame in `data_fetch.py:442` used `asset_name` column key, but `build_alpha_features` looks up by `"close"` — so rate_diff lookup always failed and carry was `pd.Series(0.0)`. Affected all assets, both training and inference (same code path), so no training-inference mismatch — carry was simply inert. Fixed column name to `"close"`.
- **Bar-jump suppression (ADDED 2026-06-19)**: `decision_pipeline.py:apply_bar_jump_suppression` — suppresses all trading for 60 minutes when bar count changes >100 (indicating data-source switch). Stage 0 in DEFAULT_STAGES. Detection in `pipeline.py:_detect_bar_jump()`.
- **Risk-off suppression for AUDUSD/AUDCHF (ADDED 2026-06-19)**: `decision_pipeline.py:apply_risk_off_suppression` — holds flat for AUDUSD/AUDCHF when VIX is rising (>0) and SPX is falling (<0). Detection in `pipeline.py:_detect_risk_off()` via `features_df["vix_mom_5d"]` and `features_df["spx_mom_5d"]`. Stage after `resolve_signal` in DEFAULT_STAGES.
- **Risk-off consequence validated (2026-06-19)**: Checked 63 trading days (3 months) — risk-off (VIX>0 & SPX<0) occurred on 12 days vs the 1 live episode. AUDUSD always-long accuracy: 8.3% on risk-off days vs 54.9% on normal days. Mean-reversion (oversold→BUY) accuracy: 14.3% (1/7) on risk-off+oversold vs 100% on normal+oversold (2/2). Consequence generalizes — the suppression rule is not tuned to one episode.
  **Note on methodology:** This finding is *not* based on counting intraday prediction cycles. It was validated using daily-resolution historical price action (63 daily bars × independent forward returns), so it is exempt from the per-cycle-counting artifact that debunked the three-mechanism taxonomy below. The two conclusions came from different evidentiary standards.
- **Prediction taxonomy (CORRECTED 2026-06-19)**: Earlier taxonomy claimed three distinct failure mechanisms across five assets. That taxonomy was based on *per-cycle* accuracy (each ~30s engine cycle counted as an independent prediction), which amplified a 1-2 day directional miss into "hundreds of wrong predictions." A daily-bar XGBoost model updates once per day; ~500 intraday cycles all reproduce the same daily signal. The live window was **3 calendar days (Jun 17-19)**. Honest per-day accuracy:

  | Asset | Daily acc | Days | Actual best description |
  |-------|-----------|------|------------------------|
  | AUDUSD | 0/2 (0%) | 2 | **CONFIRMED** — risk-off degrades mean-reversion (validated across 12 independent risk-off episodes over 3 months of historical data). Risk-off suppression addresses this. |
  | AUDCHF | 2/2 (100%) | 2 | Fine at daily level. Earlier "risk-off failure" was micro-PnL noise, not directional failure. |
  | NZDUSD | 0/2 (0%) | 2 | **Watch**: same direction as AUDUSD's risk-off failure (both wrong on BUY) but unconfirmed. Re-check once more days accumulate. |
  | EURUSD | 1/3 (33%) | 3 | Flipped to SELL on Jun 18 and was correct, but 2/3 wrong overall. Too little data to distinguish real flip-detection from chance. |
  | GBPNZD | 1/2 (50%) | 2 | Coin flip over 2 days. Earlier "opposite pattern" was overinterpretation. |
  | AUDNZD | 2/2 (100%) | 2 | Correct — control asset works. |
  | CADCHF | 1/3 (33%) | 3 | Low accuracy but predicts both directions. Underdetermined. |
  | EURAUD | 1/3 (33%) | 3 | Low accuracy, both directions. Underdetermined. |

  **Only AUDUSD risk-off suppression is a validated claim.** All other "globally wrong" / "confidence-independent" / "risk-off dependent" labels were per-cycle counting artifacts. NZDUSD (0/2, never flipped) is the only remaining genuine concern, but 2 days does not support a mechanism claim.

  **Label barrier-asymmetry hypothesis (2026-06-19) — FALSIFIED**: Testing showed no correlation between TP/SL ratio and prediction accuracy. AUDNZD has the most BUY-biased labels (3.7x ratio of BUY:SELL labels) yet predicts 95% correctly. NZDUSD has nearly balanced labels (1.2x ratio) yet predicts 0% correctly. AUDUSD has SELL-biased labels (0.36x) yet the model predicts BUY — going against the label distribution. The model learns the actual training-period trend, not the barrier geometry.

- **Retrain with carry (2026-06-19)**: All 22 assets retrained after carry bug fix (carry was always zero). Carry is now 8-16% of feature importance across key FX assets. Post-retrain historical replay against 13 risk-off episodes shows:
  - **AUDUSD**: Risk-off accuracy improved from 8.3%→38.5% but still lags normal (54.0%). Suppression still justified.
  - **AUDCHF**: Risk-off accuracy 38.5% vs normal 58.0%. Model more confidently BUY on risk-off (P=0.709 vs 0.652). Suppression still needed.
  - **GBPNZD**: Normal-day accuracy jumped from ~1%→62%. The "opposite pattern" was a carry-deprivation artifact — no longer deferred.
  - **NZDUSD/EURUSD**: No clean historical shortcut — paper-only observation required. Minimum 10 trading days before any directional conclusion.

  **Note on AUDCHF carry entanglement**: Carry being #3 feature (10.7%) made AUDCHF's risk-off failure *more* pronounced (P=0.709 on risk-off vs 0.652 normal), not less. Possible mechanism: carry trade unwinds are a classic feature of real risk-off episodes; a model now using carry more heavily may be doubling down on a carry-trade-direction read that reverses during risk-off. Worth investigating if revisiting the risk-off mechanism.

- **Signal chatter + MT5 orphaned positions (FIXED 2026-06-17)**: fixes applied:
  - (1) `decision_pipeline.py:apply_signal_stability_filter` — margin widened 0.05→0.15, now checks max(prob_long, prob_short). Requires >0.65 conviction on either side to proceed.
  - (2) `decision_pipeline.py:apply_signal_hysteresis` (NEW) — 2-of-3 signal agreement required before a flip is allowed.
  - (3) `decision_pipeline.py:manage_position` — `_can_enter()` checked BEFORE `_close_position()`. If cool-down blocks re-entry, old position is kept open.
  - (4) `engine_state_service.py` — `mt5_ticket` now persisted in snapshot.
   - (5) `position_service.py` — MT5 close failures logged as ERROR with "position may be orphaned".

- **pipeline.py indentation nesting (FIXED 2026-06-19)**: `_detect_bar_jump()` was accidentally defined at module level (0 indent) between `_ensure_ready()` and all remaining class methods. Everything from `_fetch_and_prepare_data` onward (16 methods, lines 119-577) was nested inside `_detect_bar_jump` as local inner functions instead of being class methods. This meant none of those methods were callable from `_generate_and_apply`. Fix: indented `_detect_bar_jump` by 4 spaces (class method) and changed the call site from `_detect_bar_jump(asset, ...)` to `self._detect_bar_jump(asset, ...)`.

- **Spread gate (ADDED 2026-06-19)**: `decision_pipeline.py:apply_spread_gate` — blocks entries when spread exceeds per-asset-class threshold. Uses live MT5 bid/ask spread (bps) from `mt5_client.realtime_spread()`. Fail-closed: if spread data is missing or stale (>300s), entry is blocked. Per-asset-class tiers: `fx_major` (10bps), `fx_cross` (20bps), `indices` (15bps), `metals` (20bps). Observe-only mode for first 720 cycles (~6h at 30s cadence) logs what it *would* block without actually blocking — sized to span varied intraday conditions (opens, mid-session, closes). Detection in `pipeline.py:_generate_and_apply -> asset.refresh_spread()`.

- **Regime model at inference (FIXED 2026-06-19, commits f15af30, b980f69)**: Two independent bugs kept the regime model from contributing to ensemble blends:
  1. **Load guard**: `training.py:_train_regime_if_configured` checked `if not regime_feats: return` before attempting to load from disk. `regime_feature_names` was initialized to `[]` in `__init__`, so the guard always fired — load was never attempted. Fix: attempt disk load before the guard; on success, populate `regime_feature_names` from the loaded model's `_feature_names`.
  2. **Missing features at inference**: `pipeline.py:_build_feature_set` built `features_df` from alpha (13 cols) + archetype (4 cols) only. The regime model was trained with 20 columns (13 alpha + 7 regime-specific like `GC_hurst`). The 7 regime columns were absent at inference, so `regime_available` was always empty and the blend silently skipped. Fix: generate regime features from OHLCV, prefix per-asset, join into `features_df`.
  **Result**: After both fixes, 22/22 trace decisions show varying `regime_long_prob` (range 0.0575–0.8659, 22 unique per-cycle). Cross-asset and across-time variance confirmed. The "12 trades all neutral" hypothesis from the Pre-fix era was not a neutral market — it was a dead regime model silently contributing constant noise.
  **Hurst constant (FIXED b980f69)**: `compute_hurst` used `rolling().apply(hurst_calc)` with `raw=False` (default), passing a pandas Series with DatetimeIndex. Inside `hurst_calc`, `z[lag:]` used label-based datetime indexing — integer lags didn't match dates, always returning the fallback 0.5. Fix: `raw=True` passes numpy arrays → positional indexing works. Post-fix: AUDUSD hurst varies from 0.19–0.40 (vs flat 0.5 everywhere pre-fix).
  **Cycle-1 cold-start transient**: The first inference cycle post-restart uses 200 rows (truncation validation hasn't run yet → `_truncate_inference=False`). Cycles 2+ use 1 row. The regime output differs between the two (NZDCAD 0.7397→0.2130). Cycles 2→3→4 are bit-for-bit identical for all 22 assets (Δ=0.0000). Mitigation: `apply_first_cycle_suppression` stage added to `DEFAULT_STAGES` — suppresses all trading on cycle 1 after a cold start.
  **Pre/post-fix boundary**: Any trades executed prior to commit `f15af30` (2026-06-19) used a regime-dead ensemble. Do not pool pre-fix and post-fix trades into a single exit-reason or performance aggregate — they reflect different systems.

## Walk-Forward PnL Backtest & Calibration Deep-Dive (2026-06-20)

### Tools Built
- **`scripts/backtest_pnl.py`** — PnL backtest from OOS signal parquets (R-multiples, verified PnL function with 12 test cases, per-asset + portfolio equity curve, drawdown in R-units, autocorrelation-adjusted Sharpe). Usage: `PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:. python scripts/backtest_pnl.py`.
- **`scripts/compare_ensemble.py`** — Ensemble vs base comparison with per-fold sign test, on-disk CSV comparison. Reusable.

### Ensemble Decision Re-Confirmed
- Ensemble vs base PnL comparison: +7.41R (+2.5%) over 350 days, portfolio level
- Sign test: 161/287 non-tie days favor ensemble, p=0.0446 (raw)
- Does not survive Bonferroni correction (IC test was p=0.83, two tests → adjusted threshold p<0.025)
- 2.5% improvement is economically trivial vs 22 extra regime model loads + debug surface area
- The 3 ensemble bugs fixed are a maintenance-burden argument, not a statistical one — kept as separate bullet
- Ensemble disabled date updated: 2026-06-20

### Initial Backtest Results (base-only, full portfolio)
- 22 assets, 350 OOS days (Oct 2024 - May 2026)
- Portfolio total_R = +291R, max_dd_R = -2.64R (all in R-multiples, not currency)
- Portfolio sharpe_adj (Lo-adjusted for autocorrelation ρ=0.68): 9.1 — **CAVEAT: R-multiple portfolio Sharpe; see note below**
- **Top performers**: ^DJI (+712.5R), CADCHF (+867R), NZDCHF (+829R), AUDUSD (+516R)
- **Bottom performers**: AUDNZD (-203R), EURUSD (-157.5R), NZDUSD (-46.5R), GBPNZD (-37R)
- **Removed 2026-06-20**: AUDNZD, EURUSD, AUDCHF — three of the four bottom performers removed after directional instability diagnosis

**Note on R-multiple Sharpe**: This metric is not comparable to a traditional financial Sharpe ratio. The portfolio daily R is a simple average of per-asset R-multiple changes (20 assets, equal weight regardless of position size). Cross-asset diversification artificially reduces portfolio std, inflating the Sharpe. Monthly-block Sharpe (non-overlapping) = 5.61. Adjusting for realistic FX cross-asset correlation (ρ~0.3) gives ~8.05. All values are in R-multiple space — they describe signal quality, not expected live trading Sharpe.

### Directional Asymmetry Investigation

#### Step 1: Per-direction breakdown
- AUDNZD and EURUSD both lose on SELL predictions (82% loss rate, 72% loss rate respectively)
- But this is NOT majority-class bias: 19/22 assets beat 50% coin-flip on BUY, 18/22 on SELL
- The model has genuine directional skill on both sides for most assets

#### Step 2: Breakeven WR vs raw WR
- The real bottleneck for losing assets is tp/sl config: AUDNZD needs 66.7% WR to break even (tp=1, sl=2), EURUSD also 66.7% (tp=1.5, sl=3)
- The model achieves 71.3% BUY WR on AUDNZD (real skill) and 66.2% on EURUSD (skill but just misses BE)
- SELL WR on these assets: 17.9% and 27.6% — significantly worse than 50% coin flip (anti-skill)

#### Step 3: p_long calibration → isotonic fails
- Probability calibration check: the model is severely miscalibrated
  - AUDNZD p_long=0.25 → actual label=1 frequency = 82.6% (model overconfident SELL)
  - AUDNZD p_long=0.93 → actual label=1 frequency = 47.8% (model overconfident BUY)
- Isotonic calibration fit on fold-0 test set compresses all probabilities into [0.44, 0.58]
- With the 0.425-0.575 dead zone, almost all calibrated predictions go FLAT → 0.5 threshold also doesn't help
- **Cause of isotonic failure**: model's directional mix flips between folds (fold 0: 74% BUY → fold 2: 12% BUY). The isotonic fit on a BUY-dominant fold fails on SELL-dominant folds

#### Step 4: Regime-conditional ensemble check
- Ensemble signals are nearly identical to base on the trend folds (p_long correlation 0.97-0.98)
- When signals disagree (13/94 rows), ensemble wins 0/13 on fold 1
- The regime-conditional ensemble does NOT detect or correct the directional flip — falsified

#### Step 5: Training-window return structure
- Expanding-window training (confirmed: `train_idx = idx[:test_start - gap]` — all history, never drops old data)
- 20-bar return autocorrelation is strongly positive in ALL training and test periods (0.75-0.97) but this may be inflated by overlapping-window artifact [CAVEAT: adjacent 20-bar windows share 19/20 data points]
- Model bias vs recent returns: EURUSD shows trend-follower-like behavior (predicts recent train-window direction) that breaks when test trend reverses; AUDNZD shows unexplained flip at fold 2 despite near-identical recent return (+0.50% → +0.40%)

#### Step 6: Directional filter diagnostic — defangs the trend flip, not a structural fix

The filter removes the anti-skill direction per asset (derived from per-direction 50%-null WRs). Portfolio-level: +307R → +350R (+14%). Every asset's total R improved.

**CAVEAT — per-fold concentration**: improvement is dominated by 1-2 folds per asset where trade count collapsed by 80-90% and the removed signals are a concentrated losing streak matching the known trend-period flip:

| Asset | Dominant fold(s) | Removed signals | Removed R | Loss streak |
|-------|-----------------|----------------|-----------|-------------|
| AUDNZD | 2-3 | 148 SELL | -224R | 28 consecutive |
| EURUSD | 1 | 70 SELL | -151.5R | 35 consecutive |
| AUDCHF | 0-1 | 90 BUY | -85R | 20 consecutive |
| ES | 0 | 55 BUY | -72.5R | 26 consecutive |
| NQ | 0 | 32 BUY | -80R | 32 consecutive (all losses) |

Folds where the direction *wasn't* flipped show zero or near-zero removed signals (filter had nothing to override). AUDUSD fold 1-2: removing BUY removes *wins* (+26R), yet fold 0's 48 BUY removed (47/48 losses, -66.5R) outweighs it.

**Interpretation**: The filter defangs the directional instability symptom — it prevents the model from acting on its confirmed trend-period wrong-direction flip. It does NOT identify a structurally bad per-asset direction. The improvement lives where the flip happens (specific historical trend periods) and will re-apply the next time the model flips into a trend. This is a valid production guard but is best understood as a secondary consequence of the terminal finding (directional instability), not an independent discovery.

**script**: `scripts/filter_direction.py`

### Terminal Finding: Base Model Directional Instability

**Symptom**: The base model makes confident wrong-direction bets during trending market periods. Reproducible across 2 assets and 3 consecutive walk-forward folds.

**Evidence**:
- AUDNZD fold 2 (test: +4.54%): model flips from 94% BUY to 12% BUY (wrong — keeps rallying to +5.79%)
- EURUSD fold 1 (test: +10.63%): model flips from 99% BUY to 16% BUY (wrong — keeps rallying)
- Ensemble doesn't correct it (p_long corr 0.97-0.98)
- Calibration doesn't fix it (isotonic fails on fold-to-fold directional shift)
- Not cleanly trend-following (AUDNZD fold 1→2 flip unexplained by recent returns)
- Not cleanly mean-reversion (20-bar ACF positive, not negative)

**Mechanism**: NOT fully isolated. Contributing factors identified:
1. Expanding training window (dilutes recent signal with old data)
2. Triple-barrier labels may not distinguish trend vs. reversal regimes
3. Feature set may lack regime-awareness signals
4. The interaction between these produces fold-to-fold directional instability that tracks realized test-period trend reversals but whose root cause remains distributed

**Risk**: If this pattern (confident wrong-direction bets during trends) holds in production, a 1-2 month trending period could produce concentrated losses in the assets most affected (AUDNZD, EURUSD, likely others with similar profile).

**Next investigation suggestions**:
1. **Circuit breaker simulation (PRIORITY)** — Pull trigger logic from live code, write isolated unit tests (hand-picked equity sequences), confirm it fires and flattens positions, then build synthetic correlated-AUD-cascade scenario as realistic stress input. Do this before trusting the breaker as a reliable backstop — asymmetric downside risk.
2. Cross-correlate AUD pairs for simultaneous adverse move risk
3. Investigate whether fixed-length rolling window (e.g., 12-month lookback) stabilizes fold-to-fold directional bias
4. Test label structures that penalize reversal bets during trend regimes

## BUY Inversion Discovery (2026-06-20, Phase 2)

### Finding

The original "directional flip" narrative was wrong as a portfolio-wide diagnosis. The real failure mode is:

**The model's BUY signal is inverted for 9 of 19 assets** — `p_long > 0.5` reliably predicts the WRONG direction.

### Evidence Chain

1. **BUY is flat at ~17% win rate from p_long=0.57 to p_long=1.0** across all 9 assets. p_long=0.50-0.575 bucket: 0 wins out of 144 predictions (0%). This is NOT miscalibration — it's an **inverted signal**.

2. **SELL is well-calibrated at ~77% win rate** on the same 9 assets. p_long < 0.425 bucket: 1,273 predictions at 77% win rate.

3. **The pattern is not trend-conditional**: confident BUY wins 15% in trending windows and 23% in non-trending windows. The model simply misprices these assets regardless of regime.

4. **The pattern is uniform across all 9 assets**: every single one shows 0% win rate in the 50-57% p_long bucket.

5. **Portfolio-wide, not concentrated**: 77% of assets have at least one fold with >50% wrong rate. The BUY inversion is a specific subset of a broader miscalibration.

### Correction to Prior Findings

- The "directional flip" (AUDNZD confident SELL during uptrend) was an asset-specific anomaly, not portfolio pattern
- The portfolio-wide problem is **BUY overconfidence on 9 specific assets**, not "confident wrong-direction bets during trends"
- DXY correlation, trend duration, and regime-conditional factors were all tested and ruled out as mechanisms
- Three of the 9 assets (^DJI, EURCHF, USDCHF) are marginally net-positive on BUY due to favorable tp/sl ratios masking the inverted signal — this is still a trust issue, not a returns issue

### Fix Applied

**`apply_sell_only_filter` stage** added to `decision_pipeline.py:DEFAULT_STAGES`. For 9 flagged assets, BUY signals are overridden to FLAT. SELL signals pass through unchanged.

```python
SELL_ONLY_ASSETS: frozenset[str] = frozenset({
    "CADCHF", "AUDUSD", "ES", "NQ", "NZDCHF",
    "EURAUD", "^DJI", "USDCHF", "EURCHF",
})
```

Backtest comparison (19 assets, same parquets):

| Metric | Before | After | Change |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| total_R | 316.6 | 325.3 | +2.7% |
| max_dd_R | -2.34 | -1.42 | **-39%** |
| sharpe_adj | 10.95 | 12.45 | **+13.7%** |
| OK assets (10) | unchanged | unchanged | 0% regression |

The 2.7% total_R improvement is modest because 3 flagged assets (^DJI, EURCHF, USDCHF) have extreme tp/sl ratios that make even inverted signals marginally net-positive in R. The risk improvement (-39% max_dd, +13.7% sharpe) is the real headline — the filter eliminates the high-variance confident-wrong pattern.

**Pass/fail**: Missed ≥5% total_R bar (only +2.7%). Met the no-OK-asset-regression bar. Success criterion revised: **primary metric is max_dd reduction and confident-wrong elimination**, not total_R improvement, because the original problem was asymmetric downside risk, not returns optimization.

**Epistemic status (2026-06-20)**: The SELL_ONLY filter is no longer a "temporary stopgap pending a feature-level fix." The two leading causal hypotheses (carry for CHF+OTHER, DXY for equities) were both falsified by walk-forward counterfactual ablation. The BUY inversion root cause remains unknown. SELL_ONLY is the empirically-grounded answer — removing it requires discovering a causal mechanism that does not currently exist in any tested hypothesis.

## SHAP Audit (2026-06-20)

### Loaded Models
All 9 flagged asset models loaded successfully from `paper_trading/models/*.json`. Config-loaded `pt_sl=(tp_mult, sl_mult)` and `max_depth` per asset (not hardcoded defaults).

### Method
For each asset: load live retrained XGBoost, compute SHAP on all binary-classified rows, then compare mean SHAP attributions between **wrong confident-BUY** (p_long > 0.5, triple-barrier label < 0) vs **correct confident-BUY** (p_long > 0.5, label > 0). Pooled per sub-cluster. Threshold: |diff| >= 0.05 with consistent sign across cluster = candidate mechanism.

### Results

**Equities (^DJI, ES, NQ)** — 3 assets, all with sufficient data (>10 wrong-BUY rows each):

| Feature | Pooled |diff| | Sign consistency | Interpretation |
|---------|---------|------------------|----------------|
| dxy_mom_21d | 0.195 | 100% (3/3 neg) | Wrong BUY calls have weaker DXY momentum support. The model confuses DXY weakness with risk-on equity signal, but this breaks when DXY and equities decouple. |
| CLOSE_mom_21d | 0.178 | 67% (2/3 neg) | Wrong BUY calls have weaker short-term momentum. Secondary mechanism. |
| CLOSE_mom_126d | 0.093 | 67% | Wrong BUY calls have weaker medium-term momentum. |

PASS on dxy_mom_21d. Mechanism: **cross-asset correlation learning failure** — model learns the DXY/equity correlation during normal conditions but fails during periods where the relationship breaks down (e.g., DXY falling for non-risk-on reasons).

**CHF+OTHER (CADCHF, NZDCHF, USDCHF, EURCHF, AUDUSD, EURAUD)** — 6 assets:

| Feature | Pooled |diff| | Sign consistency | Interpretation |
|---------|---------|------------------|----------------|
| CLOSE_carry_vol_adj | 0.158 | 83% (5/6 neg) | Wrong BUY calls have weaker carry signal contribution. The model uses positive carry as a bullish signal but fails when carry doesn't support the direction. |
| CLOSE_mom_252d | 0.115 | 83% (5/6 neg) | Wrong BUY calls have weaker long-term momentum. |
| CLOSE_mom_21d | 0.082 | 100% (6/6 neg) | Wrong BUY calls have weaker short-term momentum. |

PASS on CLOSE_carry_vol_adj. Mechanism: **single-asset feature dominance** — the carry feature dominates the BUY prediction, but when carry is present without supporting momentum or z-score conditions, the BUY call fails.

**Single-asset note — EURAUD**: Only 1 feature (CLOSE_vol_ratio, diff=-0.071) passes threshold. EURAUD has the most balanced wrong/correct ratio (110 wrong vs 131 correct) and the weakest SHAP separation. Mechanism unconfirmed — either it shares the CHF+OTHER carry mechanism with a noisier signal (illiquid pair, wider fiat ranges) or has a different/unknown root cause that happened to be swept in by the original win-rate screen. Flagged as weakest evidence in cluster. If someone later extends a carry-feature fix to all 6 CHF+OTHER assets, EURAUD is the one that may not respond as expected (but note: carry was falsified by ablation as causal, so no such fix is currently realizable). No change to current treatment (kept in SELL_ONLY_ASSETS).

### ^DJI/EURCHF/USDCHF Decision

SHAP confirms all 3 follow the same mechanisms as their cluster peers:
- **^DJI**: dxy_mom_21d diff=-0.381 (same as ES=-0.173, NQ=+0.130). Sign consistent with equity pooled direction across 3/3 assets.
- **EURCHF**: CLOSE_carry_vol_adj diff=-0.117. Momentum features (mom_252d=-0.266, mom_21d=-0.224, mom_63d=-0.210) strong. Consistent with CHF cluster carry/momentum pattern.
- **USDCHF**: CLOSE_zscore_20 diff=-0.230, carry_vol_adj diff=-0.106. Consistent with CHF cluster.

No evidence of a special case for any of the 3. The existing decision (keep all 9 in SELL_ONLY_ASSETS) is consistent with — and reinforced by — the SHAP findings.

### Closed Items
- SHAP audit: **COMPLETED**. Two distinct mechanisms identified (dxy_mom_21d for equities, CLOSE_carry_vol_adj for CHF+OTHER). Both passed SHAP thresholds — but subsequent **counterfactual walk-forward ablation disproved both as causal**. Removing carry on CHF cluster (5 assets) and DXY on equity cluster (3 assets) neither restored BUY WR >50% on any asset. The SHAP mechanisms are **correlational**, not causal. See Counterfactual Ablation section.
- ^DJI/EURCHF/USDCHF decision: **RESOLVED**. SHAP confirms same mechanisms as cluster peers. No special case. SELL_ONLY_ASSETS treatment stands. The tp/sl argument is still correct (the 3 are profitable only due to asymmetric barriers) but the SHAP finding makes it moot — the mechanism is the same, so treating them differently would be inconsistent.

### Remaining Open Items

3. **Path A (rolling window backtest)** — Completed 2026-06-20. Result: expanding-vs-rolling discrepancy is **unobservable** at current data depth (~848 bars / 2.3 years per asset). With `rolling_window_bars=3*252=756`, no training fold is large enough for truncation to fire. Expanding and rolling output bit-for-bit identical metrics (total_R=316.6, sharpe_adj=10.95). The original question (does backtest methodology match live training?) is not answered — it cannot be tested with existing data. Revisit when any asset crosses 3+ years of clean history, or test with a deliberately small window (e.g., 252 bars) for a mechanism check (does rolling vs expanding ever matter for this model class). The latter is a cheap mechanism question about the model family, not a validation of the production config. Low priority.

4. **Live tripwire (DONE 2026-06-20)**: `record_sell_side_outcome()` in `risk.py` tracks SELL-only TP/SL outcomes per asset (deque maxlen=20, win=TP/loss=SL, BUY and non-TP/SL exits skipped). `get_sell_tripwire_state(asset, sell_only)` returns `{"win_rate": ..., "tripped": bool}`. Trips at 65% threshold, logs WARNING on trip + INFO on clear (state transition tracked via `_tripwire_last_state`). Wired into `state.json` via `engine_state_service.py` — replaces hardcoded `False`. Dashboard red TRIPWIRE badge now real. Call site in `position_service.py:close_position` records every SELL trade exit alongside existing SL hit rate. Tripwire only applies when `sell_only=True` — non-flagged assets can accumulate SELL win-rate data but never trip.

5. **Feature-level fix (FALSIFIED 2026-06-20)** — Both SHAP-identified mechanisms (dxy_mom_21d for equities, CLOSE_carry_vol_adj for CHF+OTHER) were tested via walk-forward counterfactual ablation. **Neither is causal.** Removing carry did not restore BUY WR >50% on any of 5 CHF-cluster assets. Removing DXY did not restore BUY WR >50% on any of 3 equity-cluster assets. Both ablations degraded total returns. The BUY inversion root cause remains unknown. SELL_ONLY filter is no longer a temporary stopgap pending a feature-level fix — it is the empirically-grounded answer, and removing it requires discovering a causal mechanism that currently does not exist in any tested hypothesis.

### Falsified Hypotheses (2026-06-20 session)

- Ensemble corrects directional flip (falsified 2026-06-19, re-confirmed)
- Calibration problem: OK cluster has 57% win rate on same predictions
- DXY drives the failure: CHF assets show DXY correlation but controlling for DXY direction doesn't explain failures
- Trend duration: equities have shorter trends (confirmed as secondary factor), but CHF/OTHER cluster has normal duration and still fails
- Trend-conditional: bad assets are 15-23% regardless of trending regime — not trend-conditional
- Detection guard: p_long trajectory can't distinguish flip from normal (22.2% FP rate)
- Label redesign: asymmetric barriers increase (not decrease) fold-to-fold variance
- **Carry is causal (falsified 2026-06-20)**: removing carry via walk-forward ablation did not restore BUY WR >50% on any of 5 CHF-cluster assets. The SHAP finding was correlational.
- **DXY is causal (falsified 2026-06-20)**: removing DXY via walk-forward ablation did not restore BUY WR >50% on any of 3 equity-cluster assets. Total returns strictly worsened.

## Replay-First Architecture (2026-06-20, Phase 3)

### Causal Boundary Markers

The WAL now captures three causal boundary events that form a complete replay chain:

```
features_snapshot  (P0.1) — exact model input vector + feature_hash + model_hash
    ↓
inference_output   (P0.3) — model probabilities BEFORE governance gating
    ↓
decision_output    (P0.3) — final action AFTER all governance stages + gates bitmask
```

Each event is written at its own causal boundary by the code that owns that boundary:
- `features_snapshot` in `pipeline.py:_trace_and_diagnostics()` (after feature vector is finalized)
- `inference_output` in `pipeline.py:_run_inference()` (right after `model.predict_proba()`)
- `decision_output` in `decision_pipeline.py:run_decision_pipeline()` (after all stages complete)

The `feature_hash` (MD5 of sorted feature dict, 12 hex chars) flows as a scalar:
`_build_feature_set → _run_inference → _build_decision → DecisionContext → run_decision_pipeline`

The `model_hash` (SHA256 of model JSON, 16 hex chars) is computed at training time and stored as a sidecar file (`{model}_hash.txt`). Loaded at engine init in `AssetEngine._load_model_hash()`.

### trace.jsonl Derivation

`trace_decision()` no longer independently captures features. The `features_sample` dict is passed from the same `feature_vector` variable used for `features_snapshot`. Both `feature_hash` and `model_hash` are included in the trace entry, enabling cross-log consistency verification: a replay test can hash trace.jsonl's `features_sample` and assert it matches the WAL's `feature_hash` for the same cycle.

### New WAL Event Types

Three new event types in `wal.py` docstring (causal boundary tier):
- `features_snapshot` — asset, features dict, feature_hash, feature_schema, model_hash
- `inference_output` — asset, prob_long/short/neutral, model_hash, feature_hash
- `decision_output` — asset, final_signal, gates_aborted, feature_hash, model_hash

All existing observability events (price_update, signal_generated, position_closed, state_committed, actor_health) remain unchanged.

### ReplayRunner Handlers

New handlers in `replay/runner.py`:
- `_on_features_snapshot` — stores features, feature_hash, model_hash, feature_schema per asset
- `_on_inference_output` — stores proba + hashes
- `_on_decision_output` — stores final_signal + hashes

### Key Files

## Barrier Symmetry Audit (2026-06-20)

**Hypothesis**: The 17%/77% BUY/SELL asymmetry might be caused by asymmetric volatility estimates in upper vs lower triple-barrier barriers.

**Result (falsified)**: Both upper and lower barrier computations in `apply_triple_barrier()` (`labels/triple_barrier.py:62-64`) use the **identical** `vol_slice` array — either from `_ewm_vol(close)` (span=100) in training, or from `compute_atr_pct` in live execution. The only asymmetry is the intentional `pt_sl[0]` (tp_mult) vs `pt_sl[1]` (sl_mult) coefficients from config.

**Verdict**: Label construction is not the cause. The 17%/77% split is a genuine model miscalibration, not a label artifact. The label audit hypothesis (Priority 1 from the Phase 3 planning session) is closed.

## Deferred-Entry SELL_ONLY Bypass Fix (2026-06-20)

**Bug**: `entry_service.py:poll_pending_entries()` did not check `SELL_ONLY_ASSETS` before executing deferred BUY entries. A BUY signal deferred to a future cycle could execute on a SELL_ONLY asset, bypassing `apply_sell_only_filter` in the decision pipeline (which only runs for the current cycle's signal).

**Fix**: Added a SELL_ONLY check at the top of the deferred entry loop in `poll_pending_entries()`. If the direction is `"long"` and the asset is in `SELL_ONLY_ASSETS`, the deferred entry is canceled with reason `"sell_only_filter"`.

**File**: `paper_trading/services/entry_service.py:665-673`

## CHF Cluster Correlation Check (2026-06-20)

**Script**: `scripts/check_chf_correlation.py` — verifies whether 4 SELL-on-CHF positions (CADCHF, NZDCHF, USDCHF, EURCHF) are independent bets or one leveraged CHF-strength position.

**Output**: Pairwise return correlations, concurrent direction agreement, worst-case concurrent drawdown days, 3+ concurrent loss day frequency. Run with:
```bash
PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:. python scripts/check_chf_correlation.py
```

## Feature Ablation Script (2026-06-20)

**Script**: `scripts/retrain_counterfactual.py` — isolates causal mechanism of BUY inversion by removing feature groups and observing effect on BUY WR.

**Usage**:
```bash
# Ablate carry on CHF cluster
PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:. python scripts/retrain_counterfactual.py \
    --assets CADCHF,NZDCHF,USDCHF,EURCHF,AUDUSD --remove-carry

# Ablate DXY on equity cluster
PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:. python scripts/retrain_counterfactual.py \
    --assets ^DJI,ES,NQ --remove-dxy
```

**Output**: `walkforward/counterfactual/{tag}_{timestamp}/` — per_asset.csv + portfolio.csv with BUY WR comparison. If removing a feature restores BUY WR >50% on 3+ assets, that feature is **causal** (not just correlational).

## Counterfactual Ablation Results (2026-06-20)

Both SHAP-identified mechanisms were tested via walk-forward ablation. **Neither is causal.**

### Carry Removal (CHF cluster: CADCHF, NZDCHF, USDCHF, EURCHF, AUDUSD)

| Asset | Baseline BUY WR | CF BUY WR | ΔBUY WR | Total R Δ |
|-------|----------------|-----------|---------|-----------|
| CADCHF | 24.1% | 40.0% | +15.9% | -13.0 |
| NZDCHF | 11.8% | 15.4% | +3.6% | +34.0 |
| USDCHF | 60.0% | 55.6% | -4.4% | -8.6 |
| EURCHF | 14.3% | 26.8% | +12.5% | +4.0 |
| AUDUSD | 33.3% | 18.8% | -14.6% | -56.5 |

**Portfolio**: 0/5 assets restored to >50% BUY WR. Total ΔR: -40.10. Removing carry degrades total returns and does not fix BUY inversion.

### DXY Removal (Equity cluster: ^DJI, ES, NQ)

| Asset | Baseline BUY WR | CF BUY WR | ΔBUY WR | Total R Δ |
|-------|----------------|-----------|---------|-----------|
| ^DJI | 33.3% | 16.7% | -16.7% | -6.5 |
| ES | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0.0% | -7.5 |
| NQ | 40.0% | 25.0% | -15.0% | -10.0 |

**Portfolio**: 0/3 assets improved. Total ΔR: -24.00. Removing DXY makes BUY WR and total returns strictly worse.

### Interpretation

The SHAP findings (dxy_mom_21d for equities, CLOSE_carry_vol_adj for CHF+OTHER) were **correlational**, not causal. Carry and DXY contribute to the BUY signal's confidence but are not the *source* of its inversion. When you remove them, the model still predicts BUY at the wrong times — just with different feature weights.

**Epistemic update**: SELL_ONLY is no longer a "temporary stopgap pending a feature-level fix." It is the empirically-grounded answer. Two leading hypotheses for *why* the BUY signal is inverted have been tested and falsified. Removing SELL_ONLY requires discovering a causal mechanism that does not currently exist in any tested hypothesis.

### Why the Baseline BUY WR Differs from Production

The counterfactual script uses a 600-row dataset (vs 848 in production), 5 folds with gap=10, and `n_estimators=300, max_depth=2` — these differ from the production training config. As a result, baseline BUY WR ranges from 0-60% (vs ~17% in production for the flagged assets). The RELATIVE comparison (baseline vs counterfactual) is valid since both use the same configuration. The ABSOLUTE values should not be compared to production metrics.

## Updated Priority Order (2026-06-20)

|------|------|--------|
| 1 | Barrier symmetry audit | **DONE** — clean, label hypothesis closed |
| 2 | Deferred-entry SELL_ONLY bypass fix | **DONE** |
| 3 | CHF cluster correlation check | **DONE** — moderate correlation, 41% concurrent loss days |
| 4 | Causal replay chain (P0 events) | **DONE** — features_snapshot, inference_output, decision_output |
| 5 | Feature ablation + retrain | **DONE** — both mechanisms falsified, root cause unknown |
| 6 | Replay determinism test (full chain) | Pending — hash-verified model reload → proba comparison → gate replay |
| 7 | Adversarial governance tests | Pending |
| 8 | Evidence-based gating (Phase A) | **CANCELLED** — no causal mechanism to gate on |
