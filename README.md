Cross-sectional multi-asset research and paper trading engine with walk-forward asset selection, per-asset XGBoost models, nine-layer governance, decision pipeline suppression stages, MetaTrader 5 bridge execution (with full order lifecycle support), and a React dashboard.

---

# Design Philosophy

> alpha is fragile; infrastructure robustness matters more.

The system prioritizes:

* walk-forward validation,
* deterministic execution,
* train/serve symmetry,
* replayability,
* governance layering,
* per-asset isolation,
* and operational observability

over maximizing in-sample returns.

Every promoted asset must survive expanding-window validation before entering the live paper portfolio. Runtime execution is treated as a systems-engineering problem rather than purely a signal-generation problem.

# MT5 Bridge Integration

QuantForge can route data fetching and order execution through a live MetaTrader 5 terminal (Exness demo) running under Wine.

## Architecture

## Capabilities

* Real-time price streaming (bid/ask)
* Historical OHLCV and tick data
* Account info and position management
* Market order placement with SL/TP
* Trailing stop and post-entry SL/TP modification
* Position closing on flip, SL, TP, and time-stop

## Symbol Mapping

QuantForge tickers (e.g. `GC=F`) are mapped to MT5 symbols (e.g. `XAUUSD`) via `configs/mt5_symbol_map.yaml`.

## Capital Sync & Independent Sizing

Paper and MT5 equity are tracked independently. Paper sizing always uses the simulation's mtm_value ($100K initial capital), tracking its own peak equity and drawdown. MT5 sizing independently queries the real broker account balance at submission time for its own position size computation.

Paper and MT5 positions are sized through separate guardrail chains:

| Guardrail | Paper | MT5 (independent) |
|-----------|-------|--------------------|
| Equity basis | `sum(asset.mtm_value)` (~$100K) | `broker.get_account_summary().portfolio_value` (~$107) |
| Drawdown taper | Paper peak equity drawdown | MT5Broker._peak_equity drawdown |
| Per-position cap | `min(notional, max_position_pct × equity)` | Same formula with MT5 equity |
| Risk-per-trade cap | `risk ≤ max_risk_pct × equity`; skip if below min_viable | Same with MT5 equity |
| Leverage budget | Atomic lock decrement from shared pool | Deferred (0.01 lot minimum makes desired-vs-actual diverge) |
| Backstop multiplier | EngineOrchestrator Phase 3 | Not applied (MT5 too small) |

---

# Model Architecture

Each asset runs an independent XGBoost model with per-asset configuration.

**Training** (backtest): `multi:softprob` — 3-class (SELL/HOLD/BUY), HOLD dropped for training.
**Live inference**: `binary:logistic` — trained on {-1, 1} labels after dropping HOLD.

```text
Base model:    XGBClassifier (binary:logistic, 300 trees, LR=0.02, depth 2-5)
Regime model:  XGBClassifier (binary:logistic, 200 trees, LR=0.03, depth=2)
Ensemble:      60% base P(LONG) + 40% regime P(LONG)
Ensemble threshold: 0.15 per-asset default (EURAUD: 0.25)
```

### Base Model
Per-asset `binary:logistic` classifier trained on 13 alpha features (9 per-asset + 4 cross-asset, includes COT flag, `has_cot` zero-filled for pairs not in CFTC data).
Uses `scale_pos_weight` = imbalance ratio to correct the label skew.
Saved to `paper_trading/models/{ASSET}_model.json`.

### Regime-Conditional Model
Second `binary:logistic` classifier trained on the same alpha features **plus** 7 regime
features (hurst, kaufman_er, adx, vol_zscore, compression, utc_hour, session_vol_profile).
Generates a separate P(LONG) conditioned on market regime context.
Saved to `models/regime/{ASSET}_regime.json`. Requires `scripts/train_regime_models.py` to generate.

### Ensemble Blend
When regime models exist, the two P(LONG) values are blended at inference:
`P(LONG)_final = 0.6 × P(LONG)_base + 0.4 × P(LONG)_regime`

The ensemble threshold determines the neutral band. Default 0.15 (±0.075 around 0.5):
P(LONG) > 0.575 → BUY, < 0.425 → SELL, else FLAT.
Per-asset override via config (EURAUD: 0.25).

Ensemble is configured programmatically per-asset (not globally gated). Base model only is used when no regime model is loaded.

No shared multi-asset model exists.

# Feature Engineering

Three feature sets feed the inference pipeline: alpha, regime, and archetype.

## Alpha Features

Built in `features/alpha_features.py:build_alpha_features()`.
13 features per asset (9 per-asset + 4 cross-asset):

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `{ASSET}_carry_vol_adj` | Volatility-adjusted carry |
| `{ASSET}_mom_21d` | 21-day momentum |
| `{ASSET}_mom_63d` | 63-day momentum |
| `{ASSET}_mom_126d` | 126-day momentum |
| `{ASSET}_mom_252d` | 252-day momentum |
| `{ASSET}_zscore_20` | 20-day z-score vs SMA |
| `{ASSET}_vol_ratio` | Short/long-term vol ratio |
| `{ASSET}_dow_signal` | Day-of-week encoding |
| `{ASSET}_has_cot` | COT data availability flag (zero-filled for pairs not in CFTC data) |
| `dxy_mom_21d` | DXY 21-day return |
| `vix_mom_5d` | VIX 5-day return |
| `spx_mom_5d` | SPX 5-day return |
| `WTI_mom_21d` | WTI crude 21-day return |

Some assets additionally include `yield_slope` (GBPAUD, CADCHF, AUDNZD, EURNZD, GBPCHF) or `mom126` (EURCHF, NZDUSD).

## Regime Features (inference + regime model training)

Built in `features/regime_features.py:generate_regime_features()` from OHLCV.
7 features prefixed with `{ASSET}_`:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `hurst` | Hurst exponent — trending (H>0.5) vs mean-reverting (H<0.5) |
| `kaufman_er` | Kaufman efficiency ratio |
| `adx` | ADX(14) — trend strength |
| `vol_zscore` | Volatility shock detection (vol_10 / vol_21) |
| `compression` | Vol compression ratio (ATR_5 / ATR_20) |
| `utc_hour` | UTC hour of bar timestamp |
| `session_vol_profile` | Hourly vol relative to 20-day norm |

Used by the regime-conditional XGBoost model. The base model ignores these.

## Archetype Features (inference-only)

Derived from OHLCV for execution conditioning:
- EMA spread, ADX(14), RSI(14), Bollinger z-score

---

# Inference Pipeline

```text
 1. Fetch live OHLCV (MT5 or yfinance, 5y window)
 2. Refresh latest price
 3. Fetch macro data
 4. Build alpha features (build_alpha_features, 13 cols)
 5. Build regime features from OHLCV (generate_regime_features, 7 cols)
 6. Build archetype features (ema_spread, adx, rsi, bb_zscore)
 7. Optional truncation validation (predict last row only)
 8. PSI drift check (rolling 21d vs baseline)
 9. Base XGBoost inference (binary:logistic → P(LONG)_base)
10. Regime model inference (binary:logistic → P(LONG)_regime)
11. Ensemble blend: 0.6 × P(LONG)_base + 0.4 × P(LONG)_regime
12. Optional meta-label inference
13. FixedThresholdStrategy(0.45) → BUY/SELL/FLAT
14. Archetype classification
15. Refresh MT5 spread (for spread gate)
16. Decision pipeline stages (applied sequentially):
    a. Bar-jump suppression — suppress 60min if bar count changed >100
    b. Spread gate — block entry if spread > per-class threshold
    c. Signal stability filter — require >0.65 max(prob_long, prob_short)
    d. Signal hysteresis — 2-of-3 agreement before flip
    e. Risk-off suppression — flat AUDUSD/AUDCHF when VIX>0 & SPX<0
    f. First-cycle suppression — suppress trading on cold-start cycle 1
    g. Conviction gate — flip gate based on regime conviction
    h. Profit lock gate — block flip if unrealized PnL > threshold
    i. Manage position — close/re-open with entry gate check
17. Route through 9 governance layers
18. Position sizing guardrails (drawdown taper → cap → risk cap → leverage budget → backstop)
19. Independent MT5 sizing (same chain with broker equity)
20. Execute or defer (MT5 bridge for real broker)
```

---

# Execution Architecture

```
TradeDecision
      ↓
EntryOptimizer
      ↓
ExecutionPolicyLayer
      ↓
_can_enter()  (single entry authority)
      ↓
PositionManager → Position Sizing Chain
      ↓
Attribution Engine
```

Orders route through either:
- **PaperBroker** — simulated fills with slippage and market impact
- **MT5Broker** — live Exness demo via Wine bridge

## Entry Gates

Two additional gates protect entry quality and existing winners:
- **Entry price deviation gate** (`entry_service.py`): before submitting to MT5, compares current market price to the signal's reference price. If deviation exceeds `max_entry_slippage_pct` (default 2%), the entry is skipped — prevents entering far from the signal price due to gaps, reconnects, or execution lag.
- **Profit lock gate** (`decision_pipeline.py`): before flipping a position, checks unrealized PnL. If it exceeds `profit_lock_threshold_pct` (default 15%), the flip is blocked — lets SL/TP/trailing stop manage the exit instead of closing a winner for a new signal.

## Position Sizing Guardrails

Paper positions pass through a multiplicative guardrail chain in `_submit_to_broker()`:

1. **Drawdown taper** — linear taper from 1.0 to `size_taper_min` (default 50%) between `size_taper_start_dd` (-5%) and `size_taper_end_dd` (-15%)
2. **Per-position equity cap** — notional clipped to `max_position_pct_of_equity` (default 15%) of total equity
3. **Risk-per-trade cap** — SL risk capped at `max_risk_per_trade_pct` (default 2%) of equity; entry skipped if capped below `min_viable_position_pct` (default 1%)
4. **Portfolio leverage budget** — atomic lock-decremented from `portfolio_max_leverage × equity` pool; skip on exhaustion
5. **Backstop multiplier** — Phase 3 catch: ratchets down on notional breach, decays 0.9/cycle otherwise

MT5 positions run the same chain independently using real broker equity (minus the leverage budget). Both paths log decomposed factors (`SIZING` and `MT5_SIZING`).

## Key Invariants

### Single Entry Authority
All entry paths route through `_can_enter()`. No component may bypass centralized admission control.

### Immutable Execution Contract
```
PolicyDecision → FillResult → AttributionRecord
```
Execution artifacts are append-only and replay-safe.

### Train/Serve Symmetry
The same feature builder is used in both training and live inference.

### Replay-Oriented Persistence
Persistent state is stored in SQLite WAL mode with append-oriented semantics.

# Governance Framework

QuantForge uses independently configurable governance layers with worst-wins aggregation,
plus decision pipeline suppression stages and position sizing guardrails.

## Governance Layers (9)

| Layer                      | Frequency   | Scope     | Effect                              |
| -------------------------- | ----------- | --------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Exposure state machine     | Per tick    | Per asset | Exposure scaling                    |
| Feature stability          | Per retrain | Per asset | Validity penalty                    |
| Meta-labeling              | Per signal  | Per asset | Position scalar                     |
| Macro regime overlay       | Weekly      | Global    | Exposure + SL adjustments           |
| Liquidity regime           | Per signal  | Per asset | Exposure + halt logic               |
| PSI drift                  | Per cycle   | Per asset | Penalty + halt                      |
| Portfolio drawdown         | Global      | Portfolio | Global throttling                   |
| Entry price deviation gate | Per entry   | Per asset | Skips entry if price drifted >2%    |
| Profit lock gate           | Per flip    | Per asset | Blocks flip if PnL >15%             |

## Decision Pipeline Stages

Applied in order within the decision pipeline before governance:

| Stage                     | Effect                                  |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Bar-jump suppression      | Suppress 60min if bar count changed >100 (data-source switch) |
| Spread gate               | Block entry if spread > per-class threshold (fx_major=10bps, fx_cross=20bps, indices=15bps, metals=20bps) |
| Signal stability filter   | Require >0.65 max(prob_long, prob_short) |
| Signal hysteresis         | 2-of-3 agreement before flip allowed    |
| Risk-off suppression      | Flat AUDUSD/AUDCHF when VIX>0 & SPX<0   |
| First-cycle suppression   | Suppress trading on cold-start cycle 1  |
| Conviction gate           | Flip gate based on regime conviction    |
| Profit lock gate          | Blocks flip if unrealized PnL > threshold |
| Manage position           | Close/re-open with entry gate check     |

## Position Sizing Guardrails (5 multiplicative)

Applied in `_submit_to_broker()` — drawdown taper, per-position cap, risk-per-trade cap, portfolio leverage budget, backstop multiplier.

---

# Failure Isolation

Each `AssetEngine` executes independently via parallel orchestration (`EngineOrchestrator` with `ThreadPoolExecutor`). Failures in data ingestion, diagnostics, governance, execution, or model inference cannot halt the global engine.

---

# Dashboard

A React SPA (TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS) served on port 5000.

## Features

* 6-layer execution dashboard (FilterBar → ExecutionQualityStrip → Attribution Breakdown → MAE/MFE Scatter → Execution Friction → Trade Table)
* Governance overlays (narrative status, liquidity badges, PSI drift panel, connection status)
* Risk-parity rebalancing visualization
* Historical trade log with attribution decomposition
* Zod-validated API responses

### API Endpoints

# Known Constraints

* Paper trading only (MT5 Exness demo — no live capital)
* MT5 bridge primary data source (with yfinance fallback)
* MT5 bridge requires Wine on Linux
* Some FX crosses may produce incomplete first-cycle bars
* Macro data sourced from Yahoo Finance (DXY, VIX, SPX, WTI, TNX)
* Dashboard requires `yarn build` after asset list changes
* MT5 bridge is single-threaded — concurrent requests are serialized via RLock
* **GBPNZD** fails on `DX-Y.NYB` (DXY) data availability for certain MT5 brokers —
  trades without that macro feature; consider zero-fill or exclude from go-live
* **AUDNZD/EURAUD/AUDCHF inherent low IC** — these cross pairs have inherent negative IC
   (-0.12 to -0.005) even with production-aligned pt_sl. Ensemble threshold tuning helps
   EURAUD (0.25→IC -0.005) but AUDNZD/AUDCHF don't respond. Handle via governance chain.
* **THIN liquidity regime** is a soft warning (SL/size adjustment, no halt);
   only **STRESSED** liquidity regime halts trading
* **Confidence drift** halt requires 10+ signals for stable mean estimate (up from 3)
* **Small MT5 account** ($107 demo) means MT5 positions always round to 0.01 lots
   minimum — desired-vs-actual notional drifts upward. MT5 leverage budget deferred
* **Paper/MT5 sizing divergence** is expected — paper simulates $100K equity,
   MT5 executes on $107. Two independent sizing chains, no overlap
* **Spread gate** is in observe-only mode for first 720 cycles (~6h) — logs what it would block
   without actually blocking. Enforcement activates automatically after the observation window.
* **Exit reason canonicalization** — all tags are UPPERCASE (FLIP, SL, TP, BREAKEVEN, EXPIRY,
   GATE_CLOSED, PORTFOLIO_CIRCUIT_BREAKER). Legacy lowercase entries are migrated to uppercase
   on first read from SQLite.
