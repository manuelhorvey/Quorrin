## 1. SYSTEM OVERVIEW

QuantForge is a modular quantitative research and simulation system for **macro-driven systematic strategies across FX, commodities, equities, and digital assets**.

It implements a full lifecycle pipeline:

* Feature engineering under strict schema contracts
* Walk-forward out-of-sample validation
* Regime-conditioned signal generation
* Portfolio construction with volatility targeting
* Continuous paper trading simulation
* Multi-layer governance and adversarial validation

The system is strictly designed for **research and simulation under realistic market constraints**.

---

## 2. SYSTEM OBJECTIVE

QuantForge evaluates whether **macro-conditioned statistical structure produces persistent predictive edge under non-stationary market regimes**.

Primary research constraints:

* Structural regime shifts
* Feature interference across heterogeneous assets
* Cross-asset correlation instability
* Temporal decay of predictive signals
* Robustness under adversarial perturbation

All strategies must pass **walk-forward validation and governance gating** prior to inclusion in the simulation portfolio.

---

## 5. DATA ARCHITECTURE

### 5.1 Data Sources

* Yahoo Finance (OHLCV)
* FRED macroeconomic series
* Parquet-based deterministic cache layer

### 5.2 Feature Governance

All features are enforced via a **Feature Contract System** ensuring:

* Deterministic computation across train/inference
* Runtime schema validation
* Elimination of train/serve skew

Each asset is mapped to a **driver-specific feature subspace** to prevent cross-regime contamination.

---

## 6. MODEL ARCHITECTURE

### 6.1 Core Model

* XGBoost multiclass classifier
* Outputs: BUY / HOLD / SELL
* Configuration:

  * 300 trees
  * max_depth = 2
  * learning_rate = 0.02

### 6.2 Labeling Regimes

* **tb20**: Triple-barrier event labeling (20-bar horizon)
* **fwd60**: 60-day forward return classification

Label selection is asset-specific and regime-derived.

---

## 7. VALIDATION FRAMEWORK

### 7.1 Walk-Forward Protocol

* 5-year training window
* 1-year out-of-sample window
* Rolling evaluation (2021–2025)
* Strict temporal isolation (no leakage)

### 7.2 Evaluation Metrics

* Sharpe ratio (annualized)
* Maximum drawdown
* Directional accuracy
* Stability of positive return windows

### 7.3 Empirical Results

Walk-forward results for live portfolio assets and screened candidates.

| Asset  | Sharpe | Stability | Notes                       |
| ------ | ------ | --------- | --------------------------- |
| NZDJPY | 2.72   | 5/5       | strongest carry structure   |
| EURAUD | 2.28   | 5/5       | feature augmentation uplift |
| CADJPY | 1.70   | 4/5       | regime-dependent uplift     |
| USDCHF | 1.64   | 4/5       | screened, now live          |
| USDCAD | 1.48   | 4/5       | stable macro sensitivity    |
| USDJPY | 1.28   | 4/5       | screened, now live          |
| GBPUSD | 1.24   | 4/5       | screened, now live          |
| GC=F   | 1.06   | 4/5       | macro persistence observed  |
| GBPJPY | 1.75   | 4/5       | screened, now live          |
| BTC    | 0.83   | 3/5       | structurally unstable       |
| AUDJPY | 2.62   | 5/5       | screened, now live          |

> Results for newly promoted assets (AUDJPY, GBPJPY, USDJPY, USDCHF, GBPUSD) are from 5-year walk-forward screening with generic feature templates. Asset-specific driver features may improve performance.
