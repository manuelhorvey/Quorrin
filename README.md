## 1. SYSTEM OVERVIEW

QuantForge is a modular quantitative research and simulation system for **macro-driven systematic strategies across FX, commodities, equities, and digital assets**.

It implements a full lifecycle pipeline:

* Feature engineering under strict schema contracts
* Walk-forward out-of-sample validation
* Regime-conditioned signal generation
* Portfolio construction with volatility targeting
* Continuous paper trading simulation
* Multi-layer governance and adversarial validation

The system is strictly designed for **research and simulation under realistic market constraints**.

---

## 2. SYSTEM OBJECTIVE

QuantForge evaluates whether **macro-conditioned statistical structure produces persistent predictive edge under non-stationary market regimes**.

Primary research constraints:

* Structural regime shifts
* Feature interference across heterogeneous assets
* Cross-asset correlation instability
* Temporal decay of predictive signals
* Robustness under adversarial perturbation

All strategies must pass **walk-forward validation and governance gating** prior to inclusion in the simulation portfolio.

---

## 3. GETTING STARTED

### 3.1 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/user/quantforge.git
cd quantforge

python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3.2 Environment Configuration

```env
FRED_API_KEY=your_key_here
PYTHONPATH=.
```

### 3.3 System Execution

Start full simulation system:

```bash
chmod +x monitor_all
./monitor_all
```

Dashboard:

```
http://localhost:5000
```

Run backtest:

```bash
python equity/walk_forward_eurusd.py
```

---

## 4. LIVE SIMULATION PORTFOLIO

The system maintains a 6-asset continuously evaluated simulation portfolio.

| Asset  | Ticker   | Label | Cluster         | Allocation |
| ------ | -------- | ----- | --------------- | ---------- |
| BTC    | BTC-USD  | tb20  | momentum_crypto | 20%        |
| Gold   | GC=F     | fwd60 | real_asset      | 20%        |
| EURAUD | EURAUD=X | tb20  | eur_cross       | 22%        |
| NZDJPY | NZDJPY=X | tb20  | carry_fx        | 15%        |
| CADJPY | CADJPY=X | tb20  | oil_carry       | 13%        |
| USDCAD | USDCAD=X | tb20  | usd_macro       | 10%        |

Execution is fully simulated via a broker abstraction layer using Yahoo Finance market data.

---

## 5. DATA ARCHITECTURE

### 5.1 Data Sources

* Yahoo Finance (OHLCV)
* FRED macroeconomic series
* Parquet-based deterministic cache layer

### 5.2 Feature Governance

All features are enforced via a **Feature Contract System** ensuring:

* Deterministic computation across train/inference
* Runtime schema validation
* Elimination of train/serve skew

Each asset is mapped to a **driver-specific feature subspace** to prevent cross-regime contamination.

---

## 6. MODEL ARCHITECTURE

### 6.1 Core Model

* XGBoost multiclass classifier
* Outputs: BUY / HOLD / SELL
* Configuration:

  * 300 trees
  * max_depth = 2
  * learning_rate = 0.02

### 6.2 Labeling Regimes

* **tb20**: Triple-barrier event labeling (20-bar horizon)
* **fwd60**: 60-day forward return classification

Label selection is asset-specific and regime-derived.

---

## 7. VALIDATION FRAMEWORK

### 7.1 Walk-Forward Protocol

* 5-year training window
* 1-year out-of-sample window
* Rolling evaluation (2021–2025)
* Strict temporal isolation (no leakage)

### 7.2 Evaluation Metrics

* Sharpe ratio (annualized)
* Maximum drawdown
* Directional accuracy
* Stability of positive return windows

### 7.3 Empirical Results

| Asset  | Sharpe | Stability | Notes                       |
| ------ | ------ | --------- | --------------------------- |
| NZDJPY | 2.72   | 5/5       | strongest carry structure   |
| EURAUD | 2.28   | 5/5       | feature augmentation uplift |
| USDCAD | 1.48   | 4/5       | stable macro sensitivity    |
| CADJPY | 1.70   | 4/5       | regime-dependent uplift     |
| BTC    | 0.83   | 3/5       | structurally unstable       |
| GC=F   | 1.06   | 4/5       | macro persistence observed  |

## 8. EXECUTION SYSTEM (PAPER TRADING ENGINE)

### 8.1 System Structure

* Asset-level execution engines
* Position lifecycle manager
* Broker simulation layer
* Portfolio aggregation layer

### 8.2 Core Abstractions

* TradeDecision: model output intent
* PositionIntent: execution representation
* PositionManager: lifecycle + PnL accounting

Separation is enforced between:

* Signal generation
* Execution logic
* Accounting layer

### 8.3 Portfolio Mechanics

* Volatility-scaled position sizing
* Asset-level allocation constraints
* Drawdown-based risk halting
* Mark-to-market PnL tracking

---

## 9. RISK & GOVERNANCE LAYER

### 9.1 Validity State Machine

* GREEN → full allocation
* YELLOW → reduced exposure
* RED → halted

Transitions depend on:

* Drawdown thresholds
* Signal degradation
* Drift indicators

---

### 9.2 Drift Monitoring (5D)

* KL divergence (model shift)
* Signal flip rate
* PnL MAE
* Feature set Jaccard similarity
* Regime consistency score

### 9.3 Risk Engine Output

* Composite risk score
* Exposure scaling recommendation
* Advisory-only execution signals

2. Four-lens evaluation (model / signal / portfolio / shadow)
3. Walk-forward validation
4. MAS scoring (6-dimensional compression metric)
5. Adversarial regime stress testing (9 perturbation modes)
6. Promotion gate evaluation

### Outcome Classes

* LIVE_CANDIDATE
* PAPER_TRADING_ONLY
* SHADOW_ONLY
* REJECT

* Drift attribution analysis
* Feature sensitivity mapping
* Regime failure classification
* Longitudinal behavioral memory

This subsystem is strictly **non-executional**.
