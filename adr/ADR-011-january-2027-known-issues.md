# ADR-011: Known Issues Scheduled for January 2027 Retrain

> **⚠ Historical Context Notice** — This ADR describes a research-stage decision that influenced system evolution. Some referenced components may no longer exist in the current production system.

## Status

Accepted — documented during May 2026 codebase review. Fixes deferred to avoid
disrupting the active paper trade evaluation period (May–November 2026).

## Context

A comprehensive codebase review (2026-05-17) identified two architectural issues
that cannot be fixed during the paper trade freeze without invalidating the
performance measurement baseline.

### Issue C3: Dual PnL Accounting in AssetEngine (RESOLVED)

**File:** `paper_trading/engine.py` — `update_pnl()` method (lines 340–387)

The engine tracks PnL through two overlapping mechanisms:

1. **Position-based PnL** — `_open_position()` / `_close_position()` manages
   SL/TP exits and records trade-level returns in `self.trade_log`.
2. **Signal-based daily PnL** — `update_pnl()` also computes daily returns from
   the previous bar's signal direction (lines 373–387) and adds them to
   `self.current_value`.

When a position is open and the daily signal agrees with the position direction,
both mechanisms contribute PnL to `self.current_value`, creating double-counting.
The SL/TP path returns early (line 370), so the overlap only occurs on bars where
no SL/TP is hit.

**Impact:** Portfolio value tracking may overstate or understate actual performance
during open positions. The magnitude depends on position duration and signal
stability. This does not affect model training or signal generation — only the
paper trading PnL ledger.

**Resolution:** Added an early return in `update_pnl()` after the SL/TP check
when a position is still open (`paper_trading/engine.py:372`). This prevents the
signal-based daily PnL path from executing during open positions, ensuring a
single PnL path:
- Position open → position-based PnL only (booked on close via `_close_position`).
- No position open → signal-based daily PnL.
- Unit tests added in `tests/test_engine.py::TestUpdatePnl`.

### Issue A1: Research vs Paper Trading Model Architecture Split

**Research pipeline** uses `HybridRegimeEnsemble`:
- Global XGBoost backbone (max_depth=2, 100 trees)
- Regime-specific expert heads (per TREND/RANGE/VOLATILE)
- Protected macro expert head (0.45 blend weight)
- Full feature manifold: base + regime + structural + interaction + macro
- Directional prior adjustments + transition penalty

**Paper trading pipeline** uses standalone XGBoost per asset:
- Single XGBoost (max_depth=2, 300 trees)
- 4 macro features only (e.g., rate_diff, yield_delta, momentum, relative strength)
- No regime routing, no expert heads, no interaction features
- Fixed confidence threshold (0.45)

These are fundamentally different architectures. The paper trade validates the
simple 4-feature model, which is the one that cleared the walk-forward bootstrap
gates. The ensemble architecture has not been validated through the same
walk-forward rigor for the production asset set (XLF, BTC, NZDJPY, USDCAD).

**This is acceptable for now** — the 4-feature model is the one with proven
walk-forward stability. But the January retrain must decide:

1. **Keep simple:** Continue with 4-feature macro models per asset. Advantages:
   fewer parameters, less overfitting risk, interpretable.
2. **Graduate ensemble:** Port the `HybridRegimeEnsemble` to paper trading with
   full walk-forward validation. Advantages: richer signal, regime awareness.
3. **Hybrid:** Use ensemble for research/signal generation but keep simple models
   as a fallback/comparison.

## Decision

Both issues were documented during May 2026. C3 was resolved immediately. A1
(the architecture split) is not a bug — the simple 4-feature model is the one
with proven walk-forward stability, and the ensemble was never deployed to paper
trading. No further action required.

## Consequences

- ~~C3 dual PnL accounting~~ **Resolved May 2026** — early return in `update_pnl()` prevents double counting
- ~~HybridRegimeEnsemble and RegimeClassifier unit tests~~ **Added**
- ~~Unused dependencies removed~~ **(lightgbm, catboost, mlflow, optuna)**
- ~~Coverage source config fixed in pyproject.toml~~
- **Canonical architecture decided**: simple 4-feature XGBoost per asset with tb20 or fwd60 label routing. Ensemble architecture remains for research but is not carried forward to production paper trading. The paper trade evaluates the architecture that cleared walk-forward gates.
- Paper trade freeze (May–November 2026) remains in effect — no allocation or halt changes to existing live assets.
