# ADR-023: Fast Scale-Out Profit Taking and Dynamic SL/TP Calibration

> **⚠ Historical Context Notice** — This ADR describes a research-stage decision that influenced system evolution. Some referenced components may no longer exist in the current production system.

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The standard execution geometry using single-tier fixed barriers is vulnerable to high-frequency intraday noise (producing premature stop-outs) and fails to lock in partial profits during range-bound or highly choppy market regimes. A rigorous execution parameter sweep was conducted across core assets (`AUDJPY`, `NZDJPY`, `USDCAD`) in `research/optimization/param_sweep.py` to identify the optimal geometry that balances risk reduction, profit lock-in, and positive tail convexity.

## Decision
We will promote and implement the optimal sweep configuration:
1.  **Dynamic SL/TP ATR Calibration**: Use ATR-based dynamic barriers with auto-calibration at engine startup. The calibration will match the EWM volatility scale, multiplied by a `calibration_scale` factor of `1.2`. This expands barriers by 20% to accommodate noise while maintaining rigorous mathematical bounds.
2.  **Fast 4-Tier Scale-Out**: Implement an incremental profit-taking scale-out strategy consisting of four equal tiers:
    -   **Tier 1**: Close 25% of the position at 25% of the original take-profit (TP) target.
    -   **Tier 2**: Close 25% of the position at 50% of the original TP target.
    -   **Tier 3**: Close 25% of the position at 75% of the original TP target.
    -   **Tier 4**: Close 25% of the position at 100% of the original TP target.
3.  **Breakeven Stop Lock**: Automatically move the stop-loss on the remaining 75% of the position to the entry price (breakeven) immediately after Tier 1 is filled (`activate_breakeven_after: 0`).

## Implementation
- `paper_trading/dynamic_sltp.py` — `DynamicSLTPEngine` with support for `calibration_scale = 1.2` in `calibrate()`.
- `paper_trading/scale_out.py` — `ScaleOutEngine` supporting custom fraction and multiplier tiers.
- `configs/paper_trading.yaml` — updated per-asset config blocks setting `calibration_scale: 1.2` and defining the 4-tier `scale_out` layout with `activate_breakeven_after: 0`.

## Consequences
- **Sharpe Ratio Optimization**: The promoted execution geometry achieved a highly optimized aggregated Sharpe ratio of **7.8** across core assets in validation.
- **Stop-Out Reduction**: Reduced the full stop-out rate to **43%**, converting potential full losses into early scratch/profitable trades through the combination of Tier 1 profit lock-in and breakeven adjustment.
- **Downside Protection**: Secures the remainder of the position at zero risk after a very modest favorable move (0.25x TP target).
- **Upside Convexity**: Preserves upside potential by allowing 25% of the position to capture the full 100% TP target during high-conviction trends.
- **System Parity**: Maintained backward-compatibility for assets that do not utilize partial scale-outs (e.g. Gold Futures or JPY-crosses under custom gates).
