"""Divergence detection for trend-exhaustion signals.

Detects bullish and bearish divergences between price and oscillators
(RSI, MACD) that precede trend reversals.

Reference:
    Lo, Mamaysky & Wang (2000) — "Foundations of Technical Analysis"
    demonstrate that divergence patterns have predictive power for
    short-term reversals in equity and FX markets.

    """Detect RSI divergence — the most reliable reversal signal.

    Bullish divergence (+1): Price makes a lower low (LL) while RSI
    makes a higher low (HL).  Indicates selling momentum is exhausting
    and a reversal higher is likely.  Most reliable when the second RSI
    low is below the oversold threshold (< 0.35 in normalized RSI).

    Bearish divergence (-1): Price makes a higher high (HH) while RSI
    makes a lower high (LH).  Indicates buying momentum is exhausting
    and a reversal lower is likely.

    For each day in *close*, checks the past *lookback* bars for any
    divergence pattern.  Returns -1 (bearish), 0 (none), or +1 (bullish)
    per day.

    Parameters
    ----------
    high, low, close : pd.Series
        OHLC data (same index).
    rsi_window : int
        RSI calculation window (default 14).
    lookback : int
        Lookback window for divergence detection (default 20 bars).
    rsi_threshold : float
        Normalized RSI threshold for extreme reading confirmation.
        RSI < threshold = oversold (needed for bullish divergence).
        RSI > 1 - threshold = overbought (needed for bearish divergence).

    Returns
    -------
    pd.Series with values {-1, 0, 1}, same index as *close*.
