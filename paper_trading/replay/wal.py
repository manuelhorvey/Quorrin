"""Write-Ahead Log — durable decision-chain capture for deterministic replay.

The WAL records every step in the trading decision chain as an ordered event
stream. Each event captures both the input context and the output decision,
enabling full causal reconstruction of engine state.

Causal boundary events (P0 — required for deterministic replay):
    features_snapshot  — exact model input vector + feature hash + model hash
    inference_output   — model probabilities BEFORE governance gating
    decision_output    — final action AFTER governance gating + model hash

Observability events (supporting — not required for causal replay):
    price_update        — OHLC bar data received
    signal_generated    — model signal (entry/flat/exit + confidence)
    entry_executed      — fill result for position entry
    sl_executed         — fill result for stop-loss
    tp_executed         — fill result for take-profit
    position_closed     — position closed (any reason)
    state_committed     — full state snapshot checkpoint
    actor_health        — actor health state change
    stack_added         — pyramid layer added to an existing position
    mt5_order_placed    — MT5 market order submitted to bridge (pre-fill)
    mt5_order_filled    — MT5 order confirmed filled (retcode 10009)
    mt5_order_rejected  — MT5 order rejected (unsupported type, invalid vol, bridge error, retcode != 10009)
    mt5_order_modified  — MT5 SL/TP modification submitted
    mt5_position_closed — MT5 position closed (or already closed / close failed)

Invariants:
    I1: Events from a single source are strictly ordered by sequence.
    I2: All events are deterministic — same inputs → identical payload.
    I3: WAL writer is append-only; past events are never mutated.
